This project was created for the internship applications at Shopify. It is a React app that utilizes the OpenAI API. This app contains a basic form that when a prompt is submitted, it makes a call to the API which auto generates an intelligent response. I also incorporated the ability to store your responses through localstorage so that they persist on page refresh. Lastly, in case the user wanted to clear their responses, I added a button to do so. 


## To run this project, clone the repository and run the commands below.

# npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
